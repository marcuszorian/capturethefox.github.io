## Background
I am a second-year Computer Science student with a strong interest in malware analysis, reverse engineering, and cybersecurity principles. I am passionate about expanding my knowledge and skills in these areas.

I'm currently learning about:
- Maldoc Analysis
- C
- Ghidra

Additionally, I am working toward completing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate, with the goal of finishing it by the end of this year.

I am interested in using the skills Iâ€™ve gained through my projects, work experience, and certifications to pursue a role as a SOC Analyst. In the long term, I hope to transition into a career as a Malware Analyst or Security Researcher, where I can leverage my expertise to solve complex security challenges.
